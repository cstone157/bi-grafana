# grafana-docker

A docker grafana dashboard for prototype purpose (the default configuration is already connected to the postgres-docker, so that there is a preloaded set of data).

# NOTE: 
With Grafana the time field has to be in UTC format, to do this for example use -> TO_DATE('2021-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD') at time zone 'utc' as "time"	to convert the string '2021-01-01' into a UTC formatted date string.
To initialize submodule, first run 'git submodule init' and then 'git submodule update'
You will need to install the driver for the promtail to pull down the data from docker using 'docker plugin install grafana/loki-docker-driver:latest --alias loki --grant-all-permissions'

# For Example:
SELECT
  TO_DATE(public.t_oil.year || '-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD') at time zone 'utc' as "time",
  production
FROM public.t_oil
WHERE
  country = 'USA'


The docker-compose will start 3 containers grafana(http://localhost:3000/login), pg_container(a postgres server), and pg_admin(a pgAdmin server, a browser based database admin tool)(http://localhost:3031)
Grafana username/password - shoc/JustKeepSwimming
pgAdmin username/password - shoc@shoc.us/JustKeepSwimming

To add the pg_container in pgAdmin, first login and then add a new server with the host: postgres, username: shoc, password: JustKeepSwimming
If unmodifed the pg_container will come loaded with the parametric dataset (incomplete), t_oil in the default (for the demo of a simple dashboard), and data_gov (several large data sets)
The parametric data is divided into the siso and meped schemas, and the data_gov are in the data_gov schema.  You will have to use manual edit sql to be able to display data.

For instance:
SELECT
  TO_DATE(data_gov.meteorite_landings.year || '-01-01', 'YYYY-MM-DD') at time zone 'utc' as "time",
  count(data_gov.meteorite_landings.year) as count
FROM data_gov.meteorite_landings
GROUP BY data_gov.meteorite_landings.year



To start to project
$ sudo docker-compose up -d
To watch the logs of a container as be loaded (incase there are dashboards or databases missing)
$ sudo docker-compose up -d && sudo docker logs <cotainer_name> -f

To stop the project
$ sudo docker stop grafana pg_admin pg_container 

Cleanup the containers/images
$ sudo docker rm grafana pg_admin pg_container
$ sudo docker image rm work_grafana_bi_project_postgres

Cleanup the database (if you leave files in place they will persist).  DON'T COMMIT THE DATA FOLDER.
$ sudo rm -rf postgres/data && mkdir postgres/data
